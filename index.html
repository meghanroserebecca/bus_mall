    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h3>You will be shown three images of products. Your task is to DECIDE which product you would most like to own of the three and to CLICK on the image of that product. Once clicked, a new selection of three products will be presented.</h3>
    <p>DO NOT worry if you see an image from a previous set -- simply decide on the most desirable of the three being currently presented to you. After you have made 25 selections, a bar graph showing your preferences will pop up on the screen and you will be done!</p>
    <p>Thank you for assisting us here at Capitalist Useless Crap Research LLC. Please see the study monitor for your payment of $25 upon completion!</p>
