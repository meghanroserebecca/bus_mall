# User Stories

<ul>As a **developer**, I want to: <br />
<br /><li>Provide instructions to the user (focus group participant) so it is clear to them what they need to do;</li><br />
<li>Create an HTML page that displays those instructions and three clickable images;</li><br />
<li>When one of those images are clicked by the user, another three random, non-duplicated images are shown;</li><br />
<li> I must develop a counter to keep track track of the number of times a particular image is clicked;</li><br />
<li>Keep track of the number of times each image is shown;</li><br />
<li>Stop the ability of the user to click after 25 clicks have been registered;</li><br />
<li>After the user has clicked 25 times on images, generate a bar graph with data representing how many clicks each image received;</li><br />
<li>Develop the bar graph keeping the market research team's needs in mind: namely, clear data that they can compare across users to figure out the most sellable items to put in their crappy bus mall catalogue.</li><br />
</ul>

<ul>As a **market research team**, we want to:<br />
 <br /><li>Be able to view the data (bar graphs) generated by each participant;</li><br />
 <li>We then want to compare and measure data across users in order to figure out which items are most sellable.</li><br />
</ul>

<ul>As a **focus group participant**, I want to:<br />
<br /><li>Receive clear instructions on how to perform my role;</li><br />
<li>Get paid for my participation in the study;</li>
</ul>
